                      <br /><br />
                      Kathy is a warm and nurturing caregiver who has built strong relationships with both of our children. She is always patient, understanding, and has a knack for finding creative ways to keep our kids engaged and entertained.

                  <p>
                      In Kathy's case, her previous employer who moved to the UK was not reachable for a reference verification.
                      <br /><br />
                      The employer's contact information had changed, and Kathy was unable to locate or reach them.
                      <br /><br />
                      It's important to note that a lack of a reference verification from a previous employer does not necessarily reflect poorly on Kathy's work performance or character. There may be legitimate reasons why a reference verification cannot be obtained, and it's crucial to consider other factors such as Kathy's qualifications, experience, and personal references.
                      <br /><br />
                      This employment was only verified via visa and visa cancelation confirmation.

                    <li>Warmth and Nurturing: ISFJs naturally connect with others on an emotional level, making them well-suited for caring for children. Parents can feel confident that their children will be treated with kindness and empathy.</li>
